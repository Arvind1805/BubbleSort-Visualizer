<h1>Bubble Sort Visualizer<h1>
This project implements a visualizer for the Bubble Sort algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm passes through the list multiple times until the list is sorted.

The visualizer provides a graphical representation of how Bubble Sort operates on an array of randomly generated elements. Each step of the sorting process is visually displayed to demonstrate how elements move and swap positions until the entire array is sorted.

<h3>Demo</h3>
You can view a live demo of the Bubble Sort Visualizer here (replace with your live demo link).


<h3>Features</h3>
- Generates a random array of elements for sorting.
- Animates the sorting process step by step using colors and transitions to visualize element comparisons and swaps.
- Provides controls to start and reset the sorting process.
